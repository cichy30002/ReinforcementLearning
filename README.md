### QLearning
In this repository I'm learning Reinforcement learning. I have started with my implementation of QLearning in tensorflow to solve taxi driver problem from OpenAI gym. You can check it in  this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/cichy30002/ReinforcementLearning/blob/main/qLearningOnGym.ipynb).
### DQN
Next one was Deep Q Learning. It was a lot harder than previous algorithm, because I had problems with properly tuning hyperparameters. But finally I managed to solve famous CartPole problem from OpenAI gym using my build from scratch DQN. You can check it in  this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/cichy30002/ReinforcementLearning/blob/main/DeepQNetworkOnGym.ipynb).
### Next ideas
For my next RL project I would like to upgrade my DQN to verion based on convolutional neural network in order to play some Atari games from OpenAI gym. 
Later I'm going to get use of PPO, but I'm not sure yet if I'm going to build it from scratch.
